# MusicBoot

This is a demo app used in a workshop about Angular2boot framework. It demonstrates how easy it is to build modern web applications using Angular 2 and Java 8 through the use of the GWT compiler.
Server side code is based on Spring boot. Data is fetched from lastfm using their public rest API.
Client side code is written using jsinterop and java 8. The application produces Angular 2 code at compile time thanks to the GWT compiler.

Live Demo : Application is deployed on [Heroku](http://music-boot.herokuapp.com/)
